# Sublime Merge - Bug and Issue Tracker

## The issue list

Head straight to <https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues>
for a list of all issues 
or click `Issues` in the navigation bar on the almost-top.

Use [Github's reactions feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
to vote on issues. 
"+1" comments with no further content will be deleted without notice.

## Before creating a new issue

* **This tracker is for issues with the Sublime Merge only.**

  For issues with the Sublime Text text editor,
  refer to the [Core repository](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core).

* Search for the issue [here](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Merge/search?q=&type=Issues) 
  to check if it was already reported. 
  You may use labels for filtering the [issue list](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues) 
  by clicking any of these related to the problem you want to report or request.

## Filing a bug

1. Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** 
   that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.
*  Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, 
   giving an idea of what the issue is about.
*  Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.
   
   Be sure to include the following information:
   * Operating System
   * The version of Sublime Merge that you're using
   * Any related software which may cause SM to act strangely

   Also keep in mind to clearly separate fact from speculation.
*  Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. 
   It might be useful to include a *code example* for this.
*  Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

We won't slaughter you 
if you can't fulfill all of these steps, 
but prepare to answer a few questions 
if we think we're lacking information.

If you want to be really good at reporting bugs, 
you can also read [these guidelines](https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-5.0-branch/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html) 
for bugzilla bugs.

## Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1. Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** 
   that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
*  Explain briefly what the enhancement is 
   and why you think it would be useful.
*  Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, 
   such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behavior as opposed to something entirely new.
